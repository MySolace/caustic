# Benchmark
The ```caustic-benchmark``` package measures the performance of the various other modules. An 
implementation of Caustic for the [Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark][1] is available in my [fork][2] of 
the project. Once Caustic has greater stability, I'll look towards upstreaming my fork. A detailed 
analysis of benchmark results can be found in the [Wiki][3].
