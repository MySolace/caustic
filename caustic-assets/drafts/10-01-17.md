There exists a tradeoff between the flexibility of choice and the convenience of standardization.

This is especially true when it comes to databases. There exist a multitude of databases precisely 
because there exist a multitude of use-cases. Each database is optimized for a different workload. 
However, each database also exposes a unique interface. Historically speaking, developers have 
demonstrated that they are willing sacrifice the programmability of a standardized interface for the 
performance of specialized storage systems.

Even "standard" languages like SQL have incompatible dialects and confusing syntactic variations 
between different implementations. Furthermore, specialized NoSQL systems have been proven to scale 
will, but do so by shedding functionality.
