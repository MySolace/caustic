The key abstraction in the syntax package is the Record.

- A Record can either be a node or a leaf. 
- A Record can either be local or remote.

A node record stores a ZipList-style index of fields and a leaf stores a literal value. You can 
iterate over the fields of a node. You can copy a record to a new location, search it for a 
particular field, update the value of a field, and delete it.
