# Schema
Schema is a library for executing transactions over arbitrary datastores. Schema provides a Turing complete language for specifying database transactions ([unlike SQL](http://stackoverflow.com/a/900062/1447029)) and utilizes [Multiversion Concurrency Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control) to optimistically and efficiently execute transactions.
